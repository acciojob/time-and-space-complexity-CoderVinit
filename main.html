	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), indicating how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
